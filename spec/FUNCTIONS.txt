Can Monads be translated to CPS?

  function printHelloWorld( emitter ) {
    emitter("Hello")
    emitter("World")
  }

CPS...

  Procedure X = X -> Segment
  Function X Y = Procedure (X, Procedure Y)
  Segment = () -> [Segment]
  Emitter X = Function X () # i.e. Procedure (X, Procedure ())
  
  printHelloWorld : Function Emitter () # i.e. Procedure (Emitter String, Procedure ())
    (emitter, returnProcedure) ->
      emitter ("Hello", (emitter ("World", returnProcedure)))
    emitter returnSegment -> 

Monads:

  Let's say there's an 'emit' function like emit :: Emitter -> String -> IO ()

  printHelloWorld :: IO ()
  printHelloWorld emitter =
    emit emitter "Hello" >>
    emit emitter "World"

Back to CPS...

  So Segments are basically IO ()s that never return (segment >> segment is meaningless).
  Procedures are functions that return IO ()s which never return.
  Functions are functions that take a returnTo :: IO () and return IO ()s that include the returnTo.





  # Lazy assignment
  somevar = urn:sha1:blah
  # somevar is now a future
  # references to it will wait for the value to appear
  # if it's not already cached.
  
  # Things to do to variables...
  # Ensure that a variable has a value
  validate(somevar)
