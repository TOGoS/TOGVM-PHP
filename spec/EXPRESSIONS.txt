Lowest-common-denominator representation of programs is as JSON structures.

Expression types:   LiteralString
  

Core concepts:

  Functions
  - May result in:
    - Normal value
    - Error
      - Caller error (passed in data was invalid)
      - Internal error
        - e.g. Bug in function code, resource not found, error while doing I/O
  - Pure and impure functions.
  - Either may have side-effects detectable by actions or non-pure
    functions (but not by pure functions)
  - Pure functions are guaranteed to always return the same result for
    the same set of inputs.
  - Impure functions may return different results at different times.
  - By default, functions are pure unless they call impure functions,
    but functions may be marked as pure to force the compiler to consider
    them as such.
  
  Actions (destructive procedures run implicitly by interpreter)
  - Purpose is to have some side-effect or read some I/O from the world
  - Take no parameters, but may be constructed by functions that take parameters
  - May return a result
  - May trigger an error
  
  Data types (a mix of structural, nominative, and duck typing)

## Impure functions

Cause a lot of trouble, even conceptually.  Example:

  loop(
    someAction >>
    if( someImpureFunction(), someOtherAction ) >>
    sleep( 10 seconds )
  )

Here, if(...) can't be a pure function that returns either someOtherAction or not
if we are to expect someImpureFunction() to return different results at different
points in time.  In order to work, we'd have to rewrite this as:

  loop(
    someAction >>
    nop >>= _ ->    # This line gives the compiler an opportinity to re-evaluate
                    # the following expressions on each iteration
    if( someImpureFunction(), someOtherAction ) >>
    sleep( 10 seconds )
  )

Which sucks.  Better to just change the impure function into an action:

  loop(
    someAction >>
    actionThatInvokesSomeImpureFunction >>= z ->
    if( z, someOtherAction ) >>
    sleep( 10 seconds )
  )

This way the within-the-loop branching is made explicit by the >>=.
A compiler *could* do this automatically, but how would it know when that was appropriate?
How would it know that the programmer didn't really want the impure function to only
be invoked once, when the action was created?  One possility would be to treat
all '>>' as impure-function-result-invalidation points, but then the compiler has to
know about >>.  And then we still have trouble if there are no >>s, such as if we had

  loopEvery10Seconds( if(z, someOtherAction) )

So while it may be useful to have the concept of impure functions for high-level programs
(e.g. a function that takes a URL for an image and colorizes the image),
programs that expect different results over time must use actions to make their intent clear.

A function being impure really means that its output *may* change at any time, but
you can't rely on those changes being picked up /within an invocation of the program/.
Using impure functions is just a shortcut for when you don't really care.

To the compiler, the implications of an impure function are that:
- You can't cache the result
- You should't make any decisions at compile time based on the value
- If you can do so unobtrusively, you should indicate the impurity of functions
  to the programmer.  e.g. maybe offer an assertPure(...) operator.

## Nomenclature

  To talk about a struct...

    SomeType<TypeParameter> = class { fieldName: FieldValueType, ... }

## Type system

Equality checks always work on objects of the same nominal type.
Nominal types may imply that certain fields or methods exist.
Expression results may be casted to compatible types
(compatibility being based on whether fields and/or methods exist).

So e.g. if (not actual syntax!)

  person = class {
    field 'name' : type @ string
  }
  staff = person + {
    field 'staff ID' : type @ integer
  }

  struct A = { name @ "Derrick", staff ID @ 123 }
  struct B = { name @ "Derrick", staff ID @ 345 }

Then:

  struct A != struct B
  staff (struct A) != staff (struct B)
  person (struct A) == person (struct B)
  
  The nominal types of struct A and B are some implicit type (that
  will not conflict with any programmer-defined nominal types) and
  based on the fields.
  
  staff (struct A) cannot be compared to struct A or struct B, because the nominal types differ.

  person (person (struct A)) is invalid because person objects don't necessarily have the
  required fields to be staffs.  It may be useful to have a way to cast at runtime.

## Actions

When an action is run, it returns a list of actions to be executed next.
They will be added to a queue which is processed in FIFO order by the interpreter.
If any event handlers or timers are registered (I'm not defining how this would work right now)
those actions may be interspersed with main thread actions.

  ActionResult<T> = { next: List<Action>, result: T }

  Action<T> is an action that returns ActionResult<T>

Thoughts... 

  Actual effects are done by the interpreter context, not by the action.
  An action may call those to determine ordering, etc.

  abstract class AbstractAction {
    function andThen( $
  }

  Let's say struct CA = { first : Action; then : Action }

  Does a >> b >> c mean...

    a.andThen( b.andThen( c ) )

  Or...

    a.andThen(b).andThen(c) ?

  The former seems simpler to implement.
  Is the result the same?
    
    CA<a, [CA<b, [c]>]>    vs.   CA<CA<a,[b]>, [c]>

  The result may be the same, but the structure isn't.
  I don't think it matters.
    Actually, according to https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads:
      
      In Haskell, every instance of the Monad type class
      (and thus all implementations of (>>=) and return)
      must obey the following three laws:

      m >>= return     =  m                        -- right unit
      return x >>= f   =  f x                      -- left unit
 
      (m >>= f) >>= g  =  m >>= (\x -> f x >>= g)  -- associativity

    So I guess that settles it.  It does not matter.  Which is good because
    building a structure for actions grouped like (a (b (c d)))
    seems conceptually simpler than for (((a b) c) d) using my 'andThen' approach.

  What would (a >> b) >> c do?  It would have to be constructed as

    a.andThen(b).andThen(c)

  Which would give us...
  
    ab = CA<a, b>
    abc = CA<ab, c>
  
  step(ab) -> ActionResult { next: [b] }
  step(abc) -> ActionResult { next: [bc] }  ; Where does BC come from??  That's why this grouping sucks.

  We will have to handle the bc case at some point.  I guess this would happen by abc.step() constructing a new CompoundAction.
  
  function CA#step( ca ) {
    

## Errors

All functions and actions may fail.  How do we represent that and allow handling of failure?

Let's say we have (using Haskell syntax)

  someFunctionThatMayFail :: Integer -> Integer

And we want to call it normally.  We should just be able to say

  someFunctionThatMayFail(350)

and if someFunctionThatMayFail fails, our expression also implicitly fails.

But what if we want to handle the error?  I guess we need another function.

  evaluate(
    someFunctionThatMayFail(350),
    onFailure @ failure -> fail( "Failed to someFunctionThatMayFail!", cause @ failure )
  )

The 'fail(...)' expression is like a 'throw'.

Function failures are more like special return values than exceptions,
though.  Let's say we do something like...

   a = someFunctionThatMayFail(123);
   b = someFunctionThatMayFail(456);
   if( a > 3, a, b )

Then as long as a is valid and > 3, 


Then there's action failures...

Normally an Action returns an List<Action>
What if it fails?
I guess we could just have another operator to combine an action with a function to call on failure conditions.

  readLine.andThenWithResult(say).onFailure(failure -> say("Failure: " ~ message(failure)) >> fail(failure))
   
    structure:
      ReadLineAction { andThenWithResult: say, onFailure: failure -> say("Failure: " ~ failure) >> fail(failure))

## Stateful functions

For very high-level expressions (which our mid-level expression
representation format is meant to handle), we may want to reference
things whose state may change over time, but treat them as unchanging
for the duration of the program, such as the content of a web page
named by a URL.

It seems the proper way to handle this would be to either:
- Cache results of those expressions for the duration of the program, or
- Rewrite the program so that those values are fetched exactly once, up front.

The caching approach sounds simpler.  So I guess

  If you write a function with an impure implementation, make sure it
  always returns the same result for the same inputs.
